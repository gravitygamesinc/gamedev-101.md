## 🖌 Development Stages

There are many ways to develop a game, and each studio/developer has its own process, but they can be classified into 3 stages:  

![Imagem](https://github.com/bluegravitystudios/gamedev-101.md/blob/main/ProductionPhases.png)

## 🖌 Pre-production  
Pre-production is where your game truly begins. During this phase, you’ll develop the game's core concept, define its mechanics, and outline the overall structure. You’ll also make important decisions like which technology stack to use (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine), assigning roles within your team, and start creating early prototypes. This is the foundation of your game, and the more thorough your planning here, the smoother the production phase will be.  

**Common Steps**  
- Concept development and brainstorming.  
- Defining the game’s mechanics, story, and design.  
- Creating a game design document (GDD) to guide the development.  
- Assembling the team and choosing tools/technologies.  
- Prototyping and testing initial concepts.

## 🖌 Production  
Production is where your ideas come to life. During this phase, your team will be busy creating the game’s assets—programming gameplay features, designing characters and environments, producing animations, and crafting sound effects. This stage is all about executing the plan set during pre-production while keeping an eye on deadlines and potential challenges. Collaboration between designers, developers, and artists is key to ensuring that the project stays on track.  

**Common Steps**  
- Coding and development of gameplay mechanics.  
- Asset creation (2D/3D art, animations, sound effects, music).  
- Level design and environment creation.  
- Regular playtesting and bug fixing.  
- Collaboration between design, development, and QA teams.

## 🖌 Post-production  
Post-production is all about refining your game for release. At this stage, your team will focus on polishing the gameplay, fixing bugs, and ensuring the game runs smoothly across platforms. This phase also includes preparing for the game’s marketing, launch strategies, and ongoing support after release. A successful post-production phase ensures your game reaches its full potential when it finally hits the market.  

**Common Steps**  
- Bug fixing and quality assurance (QA).  
- Performance optimization for different platforms.  
- Finalizing marketing materials (trailers, screenshots).  
- Planning the game’s release strategy (platforms, regions).  
- Post-launch support, including patches and updates.  

# 🦾 Development Team
Each member plays a critical role in bringing the game to life, from initial concept to final release. This section outlines the key positions within the development team, detailing their responsibilities and the tools they typically use to ensure a seamless production process.

## 🔊 Audio Designer
Audio designers create and mix sounds for everything from ambient background music to character dialogues, environmental sounds, and action effects, ensuring that the game’s audio aligns with the visual and narrative components.

**Common Tools**
 Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), sound libraries, and audio editing software like Audacity and Wwise.

## ⚒ Producer
The producer is primarily responsible for project management. They coordinate the team’s efforts to ensure the game development stays on schedule, within budget, and meets quality requirements. The producer also handles communication between internal and external teams, keeps the team focused on goals, and resolves issues that may arise during production.

**Common Tools**  
To oversee the entire project, producers may use project management software such as Asana, Monday, or Trello.

## 💻 Developer
Game developers are responsible for coding and implementing the game’s systems and functionalities. They work to turn the design vision into functional code, handling technical aspects such as physics, AI, gameplay, and performance optimization.

**Common Tools**  
Developers commonly use integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio to code and a game engine, like Unity and Unreal Engine to gather all assets and build the game.

## 🎨 2D/3D Artist
2D and 3D artists create the game’s visuals, including characters, environments, textures, objects, and special effects. A 2D artist usually creates graphical elements such as sprites, menus, and interfaces, while a 3D artist models and animates characters and environments in three dimensions.

**Common Tools**  
2D artists often use software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or Krita for creating sprites and UI elements. 3D artists typically work with tools such as Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max for modeling and animation. Both roles might use Substance Painter for texturing and Unity or Unreal Engine to integrate their assets.

## 🕹 Game Designer
The game designer is responsible for creating the game’s concept and mechanics. They define the rules, progression, levels, reward systems, and gameplay balance, always aiming to provide a fun and challenging experience for players.

**Common Tools**  
Game designers often use tools like Unity or Unreal Engine for prototyping, along with software like Figma or Miro to map out game flow and UI design. They may also rely on narrative design tools such as Twine or Articy Draft. For collaborative design documentation, Notion or Google Docs are commonly used.
